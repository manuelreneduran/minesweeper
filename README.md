# Minesweeper

The classic Minesweeper experience brought to life! Click on the tiles - if you a hit a mine, game over. If the tile doesn't contain a mine but is adjacent to one, the tile will display the number of mines directly adjacent to it. If the tile has no mines around it, it will open all of the tiles around it until it either hits a mine or the edge of the board. Have fun!
